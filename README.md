# Temperature_Monitoring_System
This repo is created by Mohammed Khairallah containing a Temperature Monitoring System (Embedded Systems project) using PIC18F4620 microcontroller.


### Features:

- **Temperature Sensing**: Utilizes LM35 temperature sensors connected to specific ADC channels to measure environmental temperatures.
- **LCD Display**: Presents temperature readings on an LCD screen for real-time visualization.
- **DC Motor Control**: Controls DC motors based on predefined temperature thresholds to showcase actuator control.

### Components Used:

- **LM35 Temperature Sensors**: Provides analog temperature readings.
- **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)**: Converts analog sensor readings into digital values for processing.
- **LCD Display**: Used to show temperature readings and system status.
- **DC Motors**: Actuators that respond to temperature thresholds for demonstration purposes.
